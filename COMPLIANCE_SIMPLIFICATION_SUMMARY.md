# Compliance Simplification Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the major simplification of compliance features in Secrets Password Manager, transforming it from an enterprise-focused multi-user system to a personal single-user password manager.

## Major Changes Completed

### 1. Removed RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Deleted entire RBAC system (`src/secrets/compliance/rbac/`)
- Removed all role assignment and permission management features
- Updated compliance checks to use single-user security measures instead

### 2. Simplified HIPAA Compliance
- Removed workforce training management
- Removed security officer designation requirements
- Converted to "Personal Health Information" settings:
  - Health data review reminders (every 90 days)
  - Backup verification reminders (every 30 days)

### 3. Simplified PCI DSS Compliance
- Removed organizational policy requirements
- Removed unique user ID management (single-user app)
- Kept relevant password security features:
  - Password complexity requirements
  - Password history tracking
  - Password expiry reminders
  - Account lockout settings
- Renamed to "Password Security Standards" in UI

### 4. Simplified GDPR Compliance
- Removed consent management (no users to consent)
- Removed DPO (Data Protection Officer) requirements
- Removed breach notification features
- Kept relevant privacy features:
  - Data export capability
  - Automatic log deletion for privacy
- Renamed to "Personal Data Protection" in UI

### 5. Removed Enterprise Features
- Removed vulnerability scanning settings
- Removed penetration testing configurations
- Removed file integrity monitoring
- Removed intrusion detection settings
- Removed organizational documentation requirements
- Removed split knowledge/dual control features

### 6. UI Consolidation
- **Removed**: Separate Compliance Dashboard dialog
- **Removed**: Compliance page from preferences
- **Added**: Password Policy group to Security preferences page
- **Added**: Audit & Monitoring group to Security preferences page
- All compliance-related settings now in main Security preferences

### 7. Configuration Cleanup
- Removed 20+ enterprise compliance configuration fields
- Kept only settings relevant for personal security
- Simplified configuration structure in `config.py`

## Remaining Relevant Settings

### Security Page - Password Policy
- Enforce Password Complexity
- Minimum Password Length (8-32 chars)
- Password History (0-12 previous passwords)
- Password Expiry Days (0-365 days)

### Security Page - Audit & Monitoring
- Enable Audit Logging
- Log All Password Access
- Audit Log Retention Days (30-2190 days)

## Benefits of Simplification

1. **Better UX**: Removed confusing enterprise features
2. **Cleaner Code**: ~40% less compliance-related code
3. **Focused Purpose**: Clear focus on personal password management
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Less complex configuration and UI
5. **Improved Discoverability**: All settings in logical places

## Migration Notes

Existing users with compliance features enabled will:
- Keep their password policy settings
- Keep their audit settings
- Lose access to RBAC configurations (not relevant anyway)
- Lose workforce training tracking (not relevant)
- Settings will migrate automatically on first run

## Next Steps

The following tasks from IMPLEMENTATION_GAPS.md are still pending:
1. Convert dialogs to .ui templates (LockDialog, GitSetupDialog, GitStatusDialog)
2. Add missing Git settings to preferences
3. Add application settings (password_store_dir)
4. Re-enable Git menu items
5. Update documentation

This simplification makes Secrets a better personal password manager by removing enterprise complexity while keeping security best practices.
