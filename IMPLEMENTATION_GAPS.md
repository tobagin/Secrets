# Implementation Gaps and Action Plan

## COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Git Settings - COMPLETED ✓

All Git configuration options have been added to the preferences dialog:
- `remote_name` - Added to Advanced Git Settings
- `default_branch` - Added to Advanced Git Settings
- `commit_message_template` - Added to Advanced Git Settings

### 2. Compliance Settings - SIMPLIFIED AND COMPLETED ✓

#### RBAC System - REMOVED ✓
- Entire RBAC system removed as it's not applicable for single-user password manager
- Removed all RBAC-related code, configurations, and UI elements

#### Compliance Features - SIMPLIFIED ✓
- Removed enterprise compliance features (vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, etc.)
- Simplified HIPAA to personal health data tracking reminders
- Simplified PCI DSS to password security standards
- Removed GDPR multi-user features
- Merged relevant settings into Security preferences page
- Removed ComplianceDashboardDialog entirely

### 3. Security Audit Settings - COMPLETED ✓

Relevant audit settings have been exposed in Security preferences:
- Enable audit logging toggle
- Log all password access toggle
- Audit log retention days
- Removed complex enterprise features (log format, encryption, location)

### 4. Application Settings - COMPLETED ✓

- `password_store_dir` - Added to new Application preferences page with browse functionality

### 5. Git Menu Items - RE-ENABLED ✓

Git menu items have been uncommented and re-enabled in `main_menu.ui`:
- Git Pull
- Git Push
- Git Status
- Git Setup

## COMPLETED UI CONVERSIONS

All identified dialogs have been converted to use .ui templates:

### 1. LockDialog - CONVERTED ✓

Created `lock_dialog.ui` template with:
- Complete dialog structure
- All widgets defined in template
- Signal handlers connected via template

### 2. GitSetupDialog - CONVERTED ✓

Created `git_setup_dialog.ui` template with:
- Full dialog layout
- All preferences groups and rows
- Signal connections in template

### 3. GitStatusDialog - CONVERTED ✓

Created `git_status_dialog.ui` template with:
- View stack structure
- Header bar and buttons
- Status and history tabs
- Template child properties

### 4. PreferencesDialog - KEPT PROGRAMMATIC (APPROPRIATE)

The PreferencesDialog remains programmatic as this is appropriate for dynamic preference pages that need to:
- Dynamically show/hide options based on features
- Connect many signal handlers
- Update settings in real-time

### 5. ImportExportDialog - ALREADY USES TEMPLATE ✓

This dialog already uses a .ui template file (`import_export_dialog.ui`)

### 6. ComplianceDashboardDialog - REMOVED ✓

This dialog has been completely removed as part of the compliance simplification
